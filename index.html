            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In the Treehouse app, cards represent consumable content. Each Track, Course, Workshop, or even conference is represented by a card, with varying characteristics to help visually explain what type of content it is, as well as what state that piece o content is in. Cards have an icon denoting content type, are colored by primary topic (CSS, Ruby, etc.), can be bookmarked, shown with no activity, in progress or completed, new, available only to Pro users, coming soon, stacked to represent Tracks, and more. This versatility is essential to the Treehouse student experience.</p>

          <div class="block">
            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>Before developing a cohesive, global visual language at Treehouse, "cards" for consumable content existed almost in spite of themselves, more of a visual flourish than as a useful conveyer of essential information for the represented content. There was no course description, courses could not be started from the card itself, course progress was displayed vaguely, the cards didn't scale well responsively, and while we thought the custom artwork for each piece of content added personality, they were becoming burdensome for our visual designers to create as content production rapidly increased.</p>
            <p>We set out to improve this experience by creating a more flexible and versatile card language that would better inform and empower the student experience, not constantly require new asset production, and also scale well across platforms with varying levels of abstraction.</p>

          <div class="block">
            <h3>Project Exploration</h3>
            <p>My initial instinct was to first solve the issue of horizontal responsiveness. A topic-colored bar was added to the top of the card and the course artwork was moved to a top left alignment. This solved the horizontal responsiveness issue, but suddenly our custom artwork that was designed to be shown at a larger scale wasn't so impressive. I chose to wait to tackle other issues until the basic card structure could be further fleshed out.</p>
            <p>In my second exploration, round action buttons, time estimates and a more granular course step count were added to course cards. Tracks and Collections (RIP) were shown as visually distinct from course cards by making them taller with the potential for Collection cards to feature imagery or other artwork rather than topic colors. Other additions included difficulty tags inline with topic tags, trailer and course listing buttons on Track cards and generic content type icons added to Track and Collection cards.</p>
            <p>The third exploration has us ditching the taller Track cards for a stacked card metaphor to try to visually explain that there are multiple courses contained within. Bookmarking buttons were further fleshed out and the problem of no Start button was solved by offering one up once the course had been bookmarked. Various states are displayed, including 2 potential Home and Track cards.</p>
            <p>A fourth exploration involved mocking up cards in a potential, more contextual Library design. Topic cards with topic-themed artwork were also added.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Tracks are teacher-curated, guided playlists of courses intended for students who want to gain basic proficiency in a number of concepts. Originally called Adventures and cobbled together from a limited selection of content at the outset, they evolved into a way for us to essentially set up our own curriculums, allowing students to learn these larger concepts in an order our teachers deemed ideal. We quickly devised a tree-style progression dynamic for Tracks and released Tracks to our students without any user testing. We had also already begun to move the card language project forward to a point where the Track course cards were soon outdated. I then proposed an updated design to solve various UX flaws that were quickly uncovered with the original, rushed design, with the added impetus of incorporating the new card language.</p>

          <div class="block">
            <h3>Original Concept</h3>
            <p>Tracks were originally envisioned with tiers that would be "unlocked" as you progressed through the previous tiers. Some students did not take to this model because there was no way for them to skip through content they had already mastered. Adventures courses had no restrictions, and with no mechanism for testing out of locked tiers, we correctly faced an impossible battle convincing students that they should waste their time trudging through content they had already learned outside of Treehouse.</p>

            <h3>Production</h3>
            <p>On production, a temporary fix was soon deployed that removed all locks and allowed students to freely progress through Track courses out of order, if they wished and only after they see a reminder that we recommend they take the courses in the order in which the curriculum prescribes. This solved student outrage, but Tracks were still fundamentally flawed without the ability for us to be able to reliably gauge student knowledge after completing a Track.</p>

            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>Student feedback also made it clear that the tree structure was confusing and that resuming was awkward because no visibility was given to the current course once courses in the tree below the initial fold were those in progress. The primary goals of the redesign project were thus: to a) design the mechanism for which students could test out of tiers, b) apply the new card language to Tracks and c) to make resuming more contextual.</p>

            <h3>Project Exploration</h3>
            <p>This early exploration simplified the tree structure without removing it entirely, introduced a non-contextual global resume card, and a mechanism to test out of content tiers. The Track progress bar was also overhauled, introducing topic-colored bubbles that correlated to the topic color of the represented course, as well as mimicking the progress bubble states of the new card language.</p>

            <h3>Project Result</h3>
            <p>This production-ready mockup replaced the early card language with the production language, topic-colored the global resume button that correlated to the course currently in progress, added the current course and shifted schedule adjustment to the global resume card, and removed the tree structure entirely in favor of simple sectioned tiers. Each section could hypothetically contain 1-3 courses and once complete, each tier's "Test out" button would be replaced by a checkmark.</p>
            <p>However, because of recently shifting priorities, designers on the Web Team focused most of our energy on increasing engagement and removing friction from the core experience in order to hopefully stifle attrition. This restructuring and visual overhaul was then shelved until resources could be made available for Tracks to include exercises (new practice activities) and for a robust testing system to be built on top of our existing Code Challenge engine. In the meantime, new Tracks have simply been made flat/linear with one course per tier in order to at least make the order of progression more obvious in the tree structure.</p>
